# Priority 4 (Polish)
Add an on edit hook for ingesting game scores, using on_raw_message_edit


# Priority 5 (Known ignored issues)
In gamestatistics.py, when registering the parser its not possible to have 2 games share the same regex because of dictionary. Should be fixed by swapping the datastructure. (Currently just avoiding the collisions by slightly modifying the regex) 


Issues: 
Pips game number is different for some users. Most likely based on their locale and such. Very likely necessary to manually fix for every user
